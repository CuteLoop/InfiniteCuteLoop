Hi there! Welcome to **Infinite Cute Loop** â€“ a space where my passion for math, research, and creative teaching comes to life. I'm a graduate student with a deep love for all things math, and I built this blog to share both academic explorations and playful insights into the world of numbers.

*What you can expect:*
- In-depth research and analysis.
- Creative tutorials and fun math musings.
- Practical examples to spark inspiration.

Happy exploring!
