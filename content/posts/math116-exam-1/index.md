### Problem 9

A charter flight charges a fare of \$350 per person plus \$4 per person for each unsold seat on the plane.  
The plane holds 200 passengers. Let \(x\) represent the number of unsold seats.  
Find the revenue function \(R(x)\).

The revenue function is:

A. \(R(x)=(200+x)(350-4x)\)  
B. \(R(x)=(200-4x)(350+x)\)  
C. \(R(x)=(200+4x)(350-x)\)  
D. \(R(x)=(200-x)(1400x)\)  
E. \(R(x)=(200-x)(350+4x)\)

<details><summary><strong>Hint 1</strong></summary>

If \(x\) seats are unsold, how many seats are sold?  
\[
\text{Seats sold} = 200-x.
\]
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Hint 2</strong></summary>

Ticket price = base \$350 plus \$4 times number of unsold seats:  
\[
\text{Price} = 350 + 4x.
\]  
Revenue = (number sold)\(\times\)(ticket price).
</details>

---

### Problem 10

C. \(y=8(x-2)-4\)  
D. \(y=-4(x+2)+8\)  
E. \(y=8(x+2)+4\)

<details><summary><strong>Hint 1</strong></summary>

The tangent line at \(x=2\) has slope  
\[
m=f'(2)
\]
and passes through the point  
\[
(2,f(2)) = (2,8).
\]
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Hint 2</strong></summary>

Use point–slope form  
\[
y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)
\]
with \(m=-4\), \(x_1=2\), \(y_1=8\), then simplify.
</details>

For Problems 12–17, work must be **shown** and your final answer must be **boxed** on paper to receive full credit.

### Problem 12

Suppose it costs a company \$1286 to produce 40 pairs of shoes and \$2159 to produce 85 pairs of shoes.  
Determine the **linear** cost function \(C(x)\), where \(x\) is the number of pairs of shoes produced.

<details><summary><strong>Hint 1</strong></summary>

Think of the cost function as a line  
\[
C(x)=mx+b
\]
going through two points.
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Hint 2</strong></summary>

Use the points  
\[
(40,1286),\quad (85,2159)
\]
to find the slope \(m\), then solve for \(b\).
</details>

---

### Problem 13

Let  
\[
f(x)=\frac{x^2-4}{x^2+2x-8}.
\]
Find the following limits. If a limit does not exist, write **DNE**.

### Problem 14

A company determines that its profit, in dollars, is modeled by  
\[
P(x)=-2x^2+51x-100,
\]
where \(x\) is the quantity of hats produced and sold.  
Find the **average rate of change** of profit as the number of hats produced and sold ranges from 7 to 10.  
Give appropriate units.

<details><summary><strong>Hint 1</strong></summary>

Average rate of change from \(x=a\) to \(x=b\) is  
\[
\frac{P(b)-P(a)}{b-a}.
\]
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Hint 2</strong></summary>

Compute \(P(7)\) and \(P(10)\), subtract, then divide by \(10-7\).
</details>

---

### Problem 15

Let
\[
g(x)=
\begin{cases}
x^2+9, & x<2,\\[4pt]
4x+7, & x\ge 2.
\end{cases}
\]

a. Evaluate \(g(5)\).  
b. Solve for \(x\) when \(g(x)=19\).

<details><summary><strong>Hint 1</strong></summary>

For each part, decide **which piece** of the function applies.
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Hint 2</strong></summary>

For (b), solve both equations  
\[
x^2+9=19 \quad (x<2),
\]
\[
4x+7=19 \quad (x\ge 2),
\]
and keep only solutions that fit the correct domain.
</details>

### Problem 16

A company selling rugs has a supply function  
\[
S(x)=0.4x+700,
\]
where \(x\) is the quantity of rugs supplied, and a demand function  
\[
D(x)=-0.2x+2500,
\]
where \(x\) is the quantity of rugs demanded. Assume \(S(x)\) and \(D(x)\) represent price in dollars per rug.

Sketch an appropriate graph of \(S(x)\) and \(D(x)\) on the same set of axes.  
Identify the equilibrium point on your graph. Below your graph, identify the equilibrium quantity and equilibrium price.

<details><summary><strong>Hint 1</strong></summary>

At equilibrium, supply price equals demand price:  
\[
S(x)=D(x).
\]
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Hint 2</strong></summary>

Solve  
\[
0.4x+700 = -0.2x + 2500
\]
for the quantity, then plug back into either \(S\) or \(D\) for the price.
</details>

---

### Problem 17

The revenue function for a product (in dollars) when \(x\) desks are produced and sold is  
\[
R(x)=-0.8x^2+700x.
\]

a. Determine the number of desks that must be sold in order for revenue to be a **maximum**.  

b. Find the instantaneous rate of change of revenue when 300 desks are produced and sold.  
Interpret your answer using a complete sentence.

<details><summary><strong>Hint 1</strong></summary>

For (a), use the vertex formula for a parabola  
\[
R(x)=ax^2+bx+c,
\]
where the maximum occurs at  
\[
x=-\frac{b}{2a}.
\]
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Hint 2</strong></summary>

For (b), compute \(R'(x)\) and evaluate at \(x=300\).  
Remember that \(R'(300)\) is the rate of change of revenue per additional desk at that production level.

<details><summary><strong>Problem 1</strong></summary>

Solve  
\[
3-5x=0
\]
for \(x\):
\[
3-5x=0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
-5x=-3
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
x=\frac{3}{5}.
\]

The numerator is nonzero at \(x=\frac{3}{5}\), so this value gives a vertical asymptote.

**Answer:** C
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 2</strong></summary>

Evaluate
\[
f(0)=\frac{7\cdot 0+2}{3-5\cdot 0}
     =\frac{2}{3}.
\]

Thus the \(y\)-intercept is
\[
(0,\tfrac{2}{3}).
\]

**Answer:** A
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 3</strong></summary>

Profit is revenue minus cost:
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(x)
  &=R(x)-C(x) \\
  &=262x-(82x+5220) \\
  &=262x-82x-5220 \\
  &=180x-5220.
\end{aligned}
\]

**Answer:** B
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 4</strong></summary>

Set profit equal to zero:
\[
\begin{aligned}
0 &= 180x - 5220 \\
180x &= 5220 \\
x &= \frac{5220}{180} \\
  &= 29.
\end{aligned}
\]

So the break-even quantity is \(x=29\), which is between 27 and 31.

**Answer:** B
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 5</strong></summary>

From the graph:

- As \(x\to -1^-\), the function values approach \(-2\).
- As \(x\to -1^+\), the function values approach \(3\).

So
\[
\lim_{x\to -1^-} f(x) = -2,
\quad
\lim_{x\to -1^+} f(x) = 3.
\]

Because the left-hand and right-hand limits are different, the two-sided limit
\[
\lim_{x\to -1} f(x)
\]
does **not** exist.

**Answer:** D
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 6</strong></summary>

From the graph, a tangent line at \(x=3\) passes through the points \((1,2)\) and \((3,1)\).  
The slope is
\[
\begin{aligned}
m
  &=\frac{1-2}{3-1} \\
  &=\frac{-1}{2} \\
  &=-\frac{1}{2}.
\end{aligned}
\]

So the instantaneous rate of change at \(x=3\) is \(-\tfrac{1}{2}\).

**Answer:** A
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 7</strong></summary>

Factor the denominator:
\[
x^2-4x-12 = (x-6)(x+2).
\]

The function is undefined when the denominator is zero, so
\[
x\neq -2,\quad x\neq 6.
\]

Thus the domain is
\[
(-\infty,-2)\cup(-2,6)\cup(6,\infty).
\]

**Answer:** C
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 8</strong></summary>

Compute the composition:
\[
\begin{aligned}
g(f(x))
  &= (x+5)^2 - 3(x+5) + 1 \\
  &= (x^2+10x+25) - 3x - 15 + 1 \\
  &= x^2 + 10x + 25 - 3x - 15 + 1 \\
  &= x^2 + 7x + 11.
\end{aligned}
\]

**Answer:** D
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 9</strong></summary>

If \(x\) seats are unsold, then
\[
\text{seats sold} = 200 - x.
\]

The ticket price is
\[
\text{price} = 350 + 4x.
\]

So the revenue is
\[
R(x) = (200-x)(350+4x).
\]

**Answer:** E
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 10</strong></summary>

Set \(p(x)=400\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
400 &= 700 - 0.4x \\
0.4x &= 300 \\
x &= \frac{300}{0.4} \\
  &= 750.
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus 750 units are consumed.  
This lies between 650 and 800.

**Answer:** C
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 11</strong></summary>

The slope of the tangent line is
\[
m = f'(2) = -4,
\]
and the point of tangency is
\[
(2,f(2)) = (2,8).
\]

Use point–slope form:
\[
\begin{aligned}
y - 8 &= -4(x-2).
\end{aligned}
\]

This is equivalent to
\[
y = -4(x-2)+8.
\]

**Answer:** B
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 12</strong></summary>

Treat the cost function as a line \(C(x)=mx+b\) through the points  
\((40,1286)\) and \((85,2159)\).

Compute the slope:
\[
\begin{aligned}
m
  &= \frac{2159-1286}{85-40} \\
  &= \frac{873}{45} \\
  &= \frac{97}{5}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Now use the point \((40,1286)\) to solve for \(b\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
1286 &= \frac{97}{5}\cdot 40 + b \\
1286 &= 776 + b \\
b &= 1286 - 776 \\
  &= 510.
\end{aligned}
\]

So the linear cost function is
\[
C(x) = \frac{97}{5}x + 510
\]
(or \(C(x)=19.4x+510\)).
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Problem 13</strong></summary>

Factor:
\[
x^2-4=(x-2)(x+2),
\]
\[
x^2+2x-8=(x+4)(x-2).
\]

For \(x\neq 2\), the function simplifies to
\[
f(x) = \frac{x+2}{x+4}.
\]

**(a)** As \(x\to\infty\), the leading terms dominate:
\[
\lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)
= \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{x+2}{x+4}
= 1.
\]

**(b)** At \(x=1\), the denominator is nonzero, so
\[
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{x\to 1} f(x)
  &= f(1) \\
  &= \frac{1^2 - 4}{1^2 + 2\cdot 1 - 8} \\
  &= \frac{-3}{-5} \\
  &= \frac{3}{5}.
\end{aligned}
\]

**(c)** As \(x\to 2\), use the simplified form:
\[
\begin{aligned}
\lim_{x\to 2} f(x)
  &= \lim_{x\to 2} \frac{x+2}{x+4} \\
  &= \frac{2+2}{2+4} \\
  &= \frac{4}{6} \\
  &= \frac{2}{3}.
\end{aligned}
\]
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Problem 14</strong></summary>

Compute
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(10) &= -2(10)^2 + 51(10) - 100 \\
      &= -200 + 510 - 100 \\
      &= 210, \\
P(7)  &= -2(7)^2 + 51(7) - 100 \\
      &= -98 + 357 - 100 \\
      &= 159.
\end{aligned}
\]

Average rate of change from \(x=7\) to \(x=10\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
\frac{P(10)-P(7)}{10-7}
  &= \frac{210-159}{3} \\
  &= \frac{51}{3} \\
  &= 17.
\end{aligned}
\]

So the average rate of change of profit is **\$17 per hat** over this interval.

<details><summary><strong>Problem 15</strong></summary>

The function is
\[
g(x) =
\begin{cases}
x^2+9, & x<2,\\[4pt]
4x+7, & x\ge 2.
\end{cases}
\]

**(a)** Since \(5\ge 2\), use the linear piece:
\[
\begin{aligned}
g(5)
  &= 4\cdot 5 + 7 \\
  &= 20 + 7 \\
  &= 27.
\end{aligned}
\]

**(b)** Solve \(g(x)=19\) in both pieces.

For \(x<2\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
x^2+9 &= 19 \\
x^2 &= 10 \\
x &= \pm \sqrt{10}.
\end{aligned}
\]
Only \(x=-\sqrt{10}\) satisfies \(x<2\).

For \(x\ge 2\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
4x+7 &= 19 \\
4x &= 12 \\
x &= 3,
\end{aligned}
\]
which satisfies \(x\ge 2\).

So the solutions are
\[
x = -\sqrt{10}
\quad\text{and}\quad
x = 3.
\]
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 16</strong></summary>

Set supply equal to demand:
\[
\begin{aligned}
0.4x + 700 &= -0.2x + 2500 \\
0.4x + 0.2x &= 2500 - 700 \\
0.6x &= 1800 \\
x &= \frac{1800}{0.6} \\
  &= 3000.
\end{aligned}
\]

So the equilibrium quantity is
\[
x = 3000 \text{ rugs}.
\]

Find the corresponding price:
\[
\begin{aligned}
S(3000)
  &= 0.4(3000) + 700 \\
  &= 1200 + 700 \\
  &= 1900.
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus the equilibrium point is
\[
(3000, 1900),
\]
meaning **3000 rugs at \$1900 per rug**.
</details>

---

<details><summary><strong>Problem 17</strong></summary>

The revenue function is
\[
R(x) = -0.8x^2 + 700x.
\]

**(a) Maximum revenue**

This is a downward-opening parabola with
\[
a=-0.8,\quad b=700.
\]
The vertex (maximum) occurs at
\[
\begin{aligned}
x
  &= -\frac{b}{2a} \\
  &= -\frac{700}{2(-0.8)} \\
  &= \frac{700}{1.6} \\
  &= 437.5.
\end{aligned}
\]

So revenue is maximized when about **438 desks** are produced and sold  
(mathematically at \(x=437.5\)).

**(b) Instantaneous rate of change at \(x=300\)**

Differentiate:
\[
R'(x) = -1.6x + 700.
\]

Evaluate at \(x=300\):
\[
\begin{aligned}
R'(300)
  &= -1.6(300) + 700 \\
  &= -480 + 700 \\
  &= 220.
\end{aligned}
\]
